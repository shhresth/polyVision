          <h2 className='Coh2'>What is Electrical Engineering?</h2>
          <p className='p2'>
            Electrical engineering is one of the newer branches of
            engineering, and dates back to the late 19th century. It is the
            branch of engineering that deals with the technology of
            electricity. Electrical engineers work on a wide range of
            components, devices and systems, from tiny microchips to huge
            power station generators.Since its early beginnings, the field
            of electrical engineering has grown and branched out into a
            number of specialized categories, including power generation and
            transmission systems, motors, batteries and control systems.
            Electrical engineering also includes electronics, which has
            itself branched into an even greater number of subcategories,
            such as radio frequency (RF) systems, telecommunications, remote
            sensing, signal processing, digital circuits, instrumentation,
            audio, video and optoelectronics.

          <h2 className='Coh2'>What does an Electrical Engineer do?</h2>

          <p className='p2'>
            Electrical engineers apply the principles of electricity,
            electronics, and electromagnetism to develop electrical products
            and systems. They perform risk assessments and ensure compliance
            with safety standards and electrical engineering codes. They
            also conduct research to create new applications. Roles and
            responsibilities of rubber engineer:

          <h2 className='Coh2'>Job Opportunities for Electrical Engineers</h2>
          <p className='p2'>
            {" "}
            Electrical engineers are always in high demand in some private
            companies as well as plenty of vacancies in government sector.
            Almost all PSUs need electrical engineers. Government
            organisations such as DRDO and ISRO recruit electrical engineers
            regularly. Plenty of opportunities for freshers and experienced
            alike. An electrical engineer should also possess intermediate
            to advance level skill of a useful programming language
            (Python/C++ etc) so that their skill set can match wider
            requirements.{" "}
